*Speakers: Rob Barry of The Wall Street Journal; Surya Mattu of The Markup*

How to investigate warfare’s newest front: the cyber realm. We'll walk you through getting more information about this secretive world, including tracking down information about who owns what on the internet, disentangling server logs, studying IP addresses and analyzing malware and emails and more in this session. We’ll also talk about some of the tactics advanced hackers have used in the past to penetrate sensitive networks--and how those efforts can provide clues in future attacks.
